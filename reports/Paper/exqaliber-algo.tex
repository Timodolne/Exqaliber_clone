\section{Algorithm}

\subsection{Algorithm description}
Give a statement of our algorithm, phrase as an algorithm rather than talking about Bayes updates etc. What is implemented

State is current estimate and variance
Rules for updating state given result
Rules for selecting next update

Include detail of stopping criteria

\subsubsection{Adjustments for noise}
Changes needed for decoherence noise

\subsection{Bayesian framework}
Introduction to Bayesian stats, prior, posterior, and adaptive termination

Introduce idea of using normal distribution 


\subsubsection{Posterior properties}
Posterior mean, variance and expected variance under noiseless and decoherence noise model

\subsubsection{Normal approximation of posterior}
Details on the use of a normal approximation for posterior distribution and next prior.
Include comments about both the circular issue and tails due to indeterminacy. 

\subsection{Selecting next sample depth}
Details of greedy choice (possibly give indication of dynamic programming approach)
Noise and noiseless
