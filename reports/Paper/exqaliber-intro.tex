\section{Introduction}
Basic introduction giving definition and contribution

\subsection{Amplitude estimation}
Details of the amplitude estimation and background on its use, including Quantum Monte Carlo

\subsubsection{Statistical amplitude estimation}
Introduce idea of statistical learning of parameter to reduce circuit length

\subsubsection{Decoherent noise model}
Introduce model for decoherent noise and associated effects on statistical problem

\subsection{Related work}
Review of related work and papers

\subsubsection{Quantum phase estimation}
I am not sure if we want to make the connection in a public document but it is useful to make in an internal report

\subsection{Contribution}
This should be written last and include a map for the rest of the paper
