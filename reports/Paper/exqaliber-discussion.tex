\section{Discussion} \label{sec::discussion}
TO BE ADDED
\begin{itemize}
	\item Summary what we have done
	\item The potential incorporating for error mitigation and error correction
	\item Wider noise models
	\item How can we further bring down the requirements to accelerate?
	\item How can it be used for QPE style
\end{itemize}


%This is for internal discussions not external release
%Topics to include here include:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Directions for future including reinforcement learning
%	\item Superconducting and trapped ion thought experiment
%	\item Discussion about general dynamic programming approach for considering error mitigation and correction
%	\item Connection to QPE and applicability of thinking to that setting (maybe include small section on the more complicated statistical challenge of general state)
%	\item Circular distributions and what we know about them (probably subsection of this section or algorithm)
%\end{itemize}
